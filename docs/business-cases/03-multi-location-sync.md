# Business Case: Inventory Across Many Locations

## Overview
If you store products in more than one place, you need to know what’s in each location at any moment. If your numbers are wrong, you can sell items you don’t actually have.

## The Problem
Inventory changes all day: items are sold, shipped, received, and moved between locations. The challenge is keeping every location’s count accurate and up to date.

### How It Works (Simple View)
1. Orders come from stores and online at the same time.
2. You decide which location will ship each order.
3. You move items between locations when one is low and another has too much.
4. You keep a central view so everyone sees the same numbers.

### What Changes at the Same Time
- When you move items, one location goes down and another goes up.
- Two locations can try to sell the same last item.
- A shipment might arrive at one location while another ships to customers.

### Why This Is Important
- If counts are wrong, you sell what you don’t have.
- If transfers aren’t tracked, inventory “disappears.”
- If locations don’t agree, customers get disappointed.

### Common Challenges
- Keeping counts in sync fast enough.
- Moving stock without losing track of it.
- Preventing two customers from buying the same last item.

### Real-World Scenario
A retailer has one item left in stock:
- A store sells it in person.
- At the same time, an online customer buys it too.
If systems are not updated quickly, both sales go through even though only one item existed.
