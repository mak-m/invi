# Business Case: Ordering the Right Amount

## Overview
Order too much and money is stuck in unsold products. Order too little and you run out of stock — called a **stockout** — and lose sales because customers can't buy what they want.

The goal is to keep just enough inventory to meet demand: not too much, not too little.

## The Problem
Demand changes all the time. It goes up during holidays, down in slow seasons, and can spike after a promotion or viral post. If you guess wrong, you either run out or over‑buy.

### How It Works (Simple View)
1. Look at past sales.
2. Guess future demand.
3. Keep a small buffer for surprises.
4. Reorder when inventory gets low.
5. Adjust when actual sales are higher or lower than expected.

### What Changes at the Same Time
- Sales reduce inventory.
- New orders increase inventory when they arrive.
- Items can be reserved for customers before they ship.

### Why This Is Important
- Wrong numbers lead to wrong orders.
- A small mistake today can cause big shortages or big waste later.

### Common Challenges
- Sudden demand spikes.
- Long supplier lead times.
- New products with no sales history.

### Real-World Scenario
A clothing store orders winter coats months in advance:
- If demand is higher than expected, popular sizes sell out.
- If demand is lower, extra coats get discounted or sit unsold.
