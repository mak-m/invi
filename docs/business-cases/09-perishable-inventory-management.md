# Business Case: Selling Items Before They Expire

## Overview
Some products expire quickly. If you don’t sell them in time, you throw them away and lose money. This is common for food, medicine, flowers, and other short‑life goods.

## The Problem
Every day a perishable item sits on the shelf, it loses value. After the expiration date, it must be discarded. The challenge is to sell the oldest items first and avoid over‑ordering.

### How It Works (Simple View)
1. Record the expiration date when items arrive.
2. Sell the oldest items first — this is called **FIFO** (First In, First Out).
3. Mark down prices as items get close to expiration.
4. Remove and record expired items.

### What Changes at the Same Time
- A whole batch can expire on the same day.
- A refrigeration failure can spoil many items at once.

### Why This Is Important
- Selling expired items can be illegal and dangerous.
- Spoiled products waste money and damage trust.

### Common Challenges
- Ordering the right amount.
- Getting items from suppliers fast enough.
- Keeping items cold and safe.

### Real-World Scenario
A grocery store receives milk that expires in 7 days:
- Oldest milk must be sold first.
- Prices are reduced as the expiration date approaches.
- Unsold milk is removed and recorded as waste.
