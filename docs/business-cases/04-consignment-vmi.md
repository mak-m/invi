# Business Case: Supplier-Owned Inventory On Site

## Overview
Sometimes a supplier stores their products in your warehouse. You can use the items when you need them, but you don't pay until you actually use them. This arrangement is called **consignment** (supplier-owned stock on your premises) or **VMI** (Vendor-Managed Inventory, where the supplier also decides when to replenish).

This is convenient — you don't tie up money in inventory you haven't used — but it can be confusing to track who owns what.

## The Problem
Items on your shelves may look like yours, but they still belong to the supplier. You must know exactly when ownership changes so you don’t pay too early or too late.

### How It Works (Simple View)
1. Supplier delivers items to your location.
2. You store them but they are still supplier‑owned.
3. You use or sell items when needed.
4. Ownership changes at the moment of use or sale.
5. You pay only for what you used.

### What Changes at the Same Time
- When you use an item, it switches from supplier‑owned to your‑owned.
- If you return items, ownership switches back.

### Why This Is Important
- You need to know who owns each item at any moment.
- Bills must match exactly what was used or sold.
- Mistakes lead to disputes with suppliers.

### Common Challenges
- Keeping supplier and buyer records in sync.
- Making sure payments match real usage.
- Handling returns without confusion.

### Real-World Scenario
A repair shop keeps supplier-owned parts on site:
- Mechanics use parts as needed.
- The shop pays only for parts actually used.
- Both sides must agree on what was used each month.
