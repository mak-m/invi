# Business Case: Handling Customer Returns

## Overview
Customers return products. You must decide what to do with each item and still refund the customer quickly. This process is called **reverse logistics** — moving goods backward from customers to the warehouse, instead of forward from warehouse to customers.

If returns are slow or messy, you lose money and customers lose trust.

## The Problem
Every return is different. Some items can be sold again, some need repair, and some must be thrown away. You need a clear process so items don’t get lost and refunds don’t get delayed.

### How It Works (Simple View)
1. Customer requests a return.
2. Item comes back and is inspected.
3. Decide what to do:
   - Sell it again.
   - Repair it and sell it later.
   - Use it for parts.
   - Recycle or throw it away.
4. Update inventory and refund the customer.

### What Changes at the Same Time
- Items come back while refunds go out.
- One return can create several usable parts.
- A replacement might ship while the old item returns.

### Why This Is Important
- If you lose track of returns, you lose money.
- If refunds are wrong or slow, customers leave.
- If items go back into stock without checks, quality suffers.

### Common Challenges
- Handling a surge of returns after holidays.
- Deciding quickly what to do with each item.
- Avoiding fraud and mistaken refunds.

### Real-World Scenario
A customer returns a phone:
1. It arrives and is inspected.
2. If it’s in great shape, it goes back to stock.
3. If it’s damaged, it gets repaired or used for parts.
4. The customer gets their refund.
