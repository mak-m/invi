# Business Case: Bundles and Gift Sets

## Overview
Sometimes you sell one product that is made of several items, like a gift set or subscription box. This is simple for customers but tricky for inventory.

## The Problem
Each bundle uses several items. If you sell one bundle, all those items should go down in inventory. If you pre‑build bundles, those items are no longer available to sell on their own.

### How It Works (Simple View)
1. Decide what goes into the bundle.
2. Set those items aside or build the bundle.
3. Sell and ship the bundle as one product.
4. If needed, break bundles back into parts.

### Two Approaches
- **Pre‑built bundles**: Assemble in advance for faster shipping.
- **Build on demand**: Pick items only after the order comes in.

### What Changes at the Same Time
- When you build a bundle, the parts go down and the bundle goes up.
- When you break a bundle, the bundle goes down and the parts go up.

### Why This Is Important
- You must not sell bundles you can’t build.
- You must avoid double‑counting parts.
- You need clear counts for both bundles and individual items.

### Common Challenges
- One missing part can stop bundle sales.
- Pre‑building bundles takes space and time.
- Returns are tricky: do you resell as a bundle or break it apart?

### Real-World Scenario
A store sells a holiday gift set with three items:
- Build 500 gift sets before the season.
- Those three items are now “inside” the bundle.
- After the holiday, you may break leftover bundles back into individual items.
